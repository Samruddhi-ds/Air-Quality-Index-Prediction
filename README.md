# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction
Analyzed the air quality data of major developed/developing cities in India to find some underlying principles or patterns which will help us in predicting and forecasting the AQI with the given data. Since this data has been captured at specific intervals over a period of time, I have conducted a Time Series Analysis to predict the AQI of the country for next one year and check the effect of covid pandemic in 2020 on the quality of air.
